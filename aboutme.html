          <h1 class="">About Shane
            <br>
          </h1>
          <p class="lead">Currently residing in Bowling Green, KY, with his significant other. Currently, they have no pets, and they both believe this to be a travesty, but it wouldn't be right to have a dog in an apartment this small. He has one younger sibling who
            has bore him a beautiful baby niece, and an almost brother in law who has made a nephew for him. Pop culture is his strong point, having seen most movies from the late 60's forward and purveying all sorts of musics, both good and bad. Spending
            most of his time playing video games and practicing amateur programming, he thought, "Might as well get paid for my hobby."
            <br>
            <br>His gaming habit is extensive, and if its on a console older than the Playstation 3, he has most certainly played it.
            <br>Currently he plays a lot of Player Unknown's Battle Grounds, Friday the 13th The Game, The Darwin Project, and Sea of Thieves.&nbsp;</p>
